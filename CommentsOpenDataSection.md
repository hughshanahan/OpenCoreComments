**Comments on the Open Data slides from TOPS OpenCore**

*In general it is worth pointing the team to the paper "Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR" (Garcia et al. Plos Comp Bio, 2020 DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854). Stylistically there's a need to ask are the slides meant to be presented in a seminar-type format (in which case they need to spread out the content as there is far too much content per slide) or if it's meant to be read (in which case it should be develped as a document, e.g. a gitbook). *

- Instead of referencing the github repo, they should reference the Zenodo DOI. This is very much practicing what they preach as they note the importance of using PIDs.

- With respect to licencing, I am surprised on the focus on CC-0. They point to a NASA recommendation on using CC-0 but I remain unconvinced that CC-BY can't be used and this enables data citing. 

- In lesson 4 (page 12) there is a strong impression that setting DOIs is not trivial. This needs to be clarified.

- Despite the multiple links it still feels as if there is an expectation for the reader to do all this on their own. In other words, it's missing the equivalent of the section on tips for who to reach out to.

- This is more debateable but there should be some more discussion of the Data Life Cycle and how that is distinct from the linear model of research then publication.
